## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahul8879/swiggy_demand_modelling.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

After cloning, move into the project directory:

```bash
cd swiggy_demand_modelling
```

### 3. **_Create Your Own Branch_**

To work on your own feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
```

Replace <branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., data-preprocessing, model-training).

### 4. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

- On Linux/MacOS:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate

  ```

### 5. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries specified in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
