# Demand Forecasting for Delivery Service

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a demand forecasting system for a delivery service to predict order demand at various locations and times. The solution will help delivery managers optimize resource allocation, reduce delivery delays, and enhance customer satisfaction by leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques.

## **User Story**

**As a delivery service manager,**  
I want to predict order demand at different locations and times,  
So that I can optimize resource allocation and improve customer satisfaction.

## **Key Features**

- Predicts order demand for the next 7 days at hourly intervals.
- Provides confidence intervals for predictions (e.g., ±5 orders).
- Updates the forecasting model weekly with the latest data for improved accuracy.
- Considers diverse features, including:
  - Historical location-specific demand.
  - Temporal factors (e.g., time of day, day of the week, holidays).
  - Environmental factors (e.g., weather, traffic).
  - Event-driven demand spikes.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- Accurate demand forecasts displayed on a user-friendly dashboard.
- Integration with existing operational systems for seamless scheduling.
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE or MAE.

## **Project Tasks**

1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Development of a forecasting model (e.g., LSTM or ARIMA).
3. Model evaluation and validation with historical data.
4. Deployment of the forecasting tool.
5. Integration with a dashboard for delivery managers.
6. Weekly model updates with the latest data.

## **Assumptions**

- Historical data is complete and includes order details, weather, and traffic.
- The dashboard integrates with existing operational tools for streamlined operations.
